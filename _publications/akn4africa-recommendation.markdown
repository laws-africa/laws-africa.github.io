# Introduction

The Akoma Ntoso (AKN) Naming Convention for uniquely naming documents and elements within them provides a framework for naming documents in a consistent and replicable way. This is crucial for referring to other pieces of legislation (or any of their provisions) from a given AKN document.

The aim of the AKN4Africa Recommendation is to provide guidance on the implementation of this framework in the African context, taking into account documents from African countries and regional bodies and their drafting traditions. The AKN4UN and AKN4EU projects provide similar guidance for applying AKN naming conventions to UN and EU documents.

This Recommendation is meant for users already familiar with the AKN standard and conventions, as the intention is to add to the existing standard rather than reinventing any of it.

Laws.Africa is not an official body like the UN or the EU, but we also havenâ€™t found an existing convention for using AKN in the African context. We are therefore publishing our interpretation of the AKN standard for documents from African jurisdictions:

* based on our experience supporting African governments that are building their own AKN collections, and applying AKN to documents across a number of African jurisdictions;

* as a recommendation to other users of AKN across Africa for how to generate FRBR URIs (and eIds); and

* to help anyone resolving links to Laws.Africa-generated AKN documents.
