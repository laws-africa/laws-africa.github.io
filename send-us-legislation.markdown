We welcome contributions of legislation to add to Laws.Africa. It is best to share legislation as it was originally published in the government gazette.

**Please note:** We cannot accept legislation from other legal publishers. Copies of government gazettes are best.

You can send it to us in a number of ways, including:
- Depositing files on Dropbox
- Depositing files in Google Drive
- Sending files via email

Please fill in the form below to tell us a bit more about the legislation youâ€™d like to share with us.
