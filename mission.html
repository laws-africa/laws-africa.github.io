        <p>
          Legal systems cannot function fairly or effectively without shared agreement on what the law says. Both the public and private sectors must have equal access to the text of the law.
        </p>

        <p>
          Through our publication partners, Laws.Africa provides current and reliable digital legislation to judges, magistrates, advocates, attorneys, researchers, students and governments.
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>Legal practitioners have up-to-date access to the latest legislation.</li>
          <li>Acts are updated within days, not years.</li>
          <li>Sole practitioners, and both small and large law firms, all have equal access, for free.</li>
          <li>Together with <a href="https://africanlii.org">AfricanLII.org</a>, we save the African legal community millions of dollars in subscription
            fees every year.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          We conduct ongoing user research to understand the needs of a wide range of legal information users and
          stakeholders across Africa, and use this to continually improve the availability and accessibility of this information.

          Capacity building within African governments
        </h3>

        <p>
          Many African governments lack the capacity to manage their own legislation and are forced to delegate the consolidation and publication of their laws to private companies. They must then buy back their own laws with restrictive licensing that limits the re-use.
        </p>

        <p>
          Laws.Africa re-capacitates African governments to modernise their legislation publication processes and make foundational legal information available to the public. We believe in open access and ensuring that governments have full ownership of their legislation.
        </p>

        <p>
          We offer our platforms, knowledge base and training to Attorneys General’s offices, Law Reform Commissions, Government Printers, Parliaments and Judiciaries across the continent in support of their work and mandates.

        <p>
          Businesses of all sizes are faced with an ever-greater need for regulatory compliance. Small and
          medium businesses in particular are negatively affected if they do not have access to up-to-date
          regulations, placing their businesses, customers and employees at risk.
        </p>

        <p>
          Regional, national and municipal regulations are all important parts of the regulatory landscape.
          From cross-border trade to waste disposal for small hair salons, Laws.Africa’s growing collection of
          African acts and regulations evens the playing field for businesses of all sizes.
