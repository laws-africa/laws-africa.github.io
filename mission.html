              In most African countries, there is no free source of high quality, up-to-date legislation. Millions of
              Africans do not have access to the laws that govern them.
            </p>

            <p>
              Laws.Africa makes African law more accessible and usable. We provide digital, high-quality and accurate
              African law to audiences in Africa and the world, in support of the rule of law and development.

              <p>
                Legal systems cannot function fairly or effectively without shared agreement on what the law says. Both the public and private sectors must have equal access to the text of the law.
              </p>

              <p>
                Through our publication partners, Laws.Africa provides current and reliable digital legislation to judges, magistrates, advocates, attorneys, researchers, students and governments.

                We conduct ongoing user research to understand the needs of a wide range of legal information users and
                stakeholders across Africa, and use this to continually improve the availability and accessibility of this information.

              <p>
                Everyone has the right to know the laws that govern them, and the responsibility to act within those laws.
                Free and equal access to the law provides a foundation for equality, conflict-resolution and empowerment,
                and helps communities to cooperate and function effectively.
              </p>
              <p>
                Laws.Africa works with publishing partners to take the law to those who need it. Our technology underpins
                and enables the largest collection of freely available African legal information
                in the world, serving hundreds of thousands of users every month.

                Capacity building within African governments
              </h3>

              <p>
                Many African governments lack the capacity to manage their own legislation and are forced to delegate the consolidation and publication of their laws to private companies. They must then buy back their own laws with restrictive licensing that limits the re-use.
                Laws.Africa re-capacitates African governments to modernise their legislation publication processes and make foundational legal information available to the public. We believe in open access and ensuring that governments have full ownership of their legislation.
                We offer our platforms, knowledge base and training to Attorneys General’s offices, Law Reform Commissions, Government Printers, Parliaments and Judiciaries across the continent in support of their work and mandates.

              <p>
                Laws.Africa works with funders, the legal and justice sectors, and non-profit organisations to help them
                incorporate primary legal information from our openly licensed collections into their access to justice
                activities. This enables more efficient, higher-impact outreach and programming.

            <p>
              Businesses of all sizes are faced with an ever-greater need for regulatory compliance. Small and
              medium businesses in particular are negatively affected if they do not have access to up-to-date
              regulations, placing their businesses, customers and employees at risk.
            </p>

            <p>
              Regional, national and municipal regulations are all important parts of the regulatory landscape.
              From cross-border trade to waste disposal for small hair salons, Laws.Africa’s growing collection of
              African acts and regulations evens the playing field for businesses of all sizes.

              Small businesses and the informal sector are an essential part of African economies, yet they have limited
              access to professional legal advice and resources. Free access to basic legal information helps these
              businesses to grow and support families and communities.

              Our machine-readable legislation data is a building block for innovators and entrepreneurs. Traditional
              Word and PDF files lock in value and prevent re-use. Laws.Africa uses the open Akoma Ntoso XML standard
              for legislative documents, which separates content, structure and presentation and supports analysis,
              machine learning and app development.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our legislation content API is available for free for non-profit use, and under flexible licensing
              terms for commercial applications.
