          <p class="lead mb-3">
            Laws.Africa’s mission is to enable African governments to sustainably provide free access to reliable
            digital laws in a way that is user-friendly, accessible, educational and re-usable. This empowers
            individuals, communities, government, businesses and innovators in support of our vision of an Africa of
            good governance, democracy, respect for human rights, justice and the rule of law.

            <p>
              In most African countries, there is no free source of high quality, up-to-date legislation. Millions of
              Africans do not have access to the laws that govern them.

                  <p>
                    Legal systems cannot function fairly or effectively without shared agreement on what the law says. Both the public and private sectors must have equal access to the text of the law.

                  <p>
                    Through our publication partners, Laws.Africa provides current and reliable digital legislation to judges, magistrates, advocates, attorneys, researchers, students and governments.

                    We conduct ongoing user research to understand the needs of a wide range of legal information users and
                    stakeholders across Africa, and use this to continually improve the availability and accessibility of this information.
                  </p>

                  <p><u><strong>Respect for the law</strong></u></p>
                  <p>
                    Everyone has the right to know the laws that govern them, and the responsibility to act within those laws.
                    Free and equal access to the law provides a foundation for equality, conflict-resolution and empowerment,
                    and helps communities to cooperate and function effectively.

                  <p>
                    Laws.Africa works with publishing partners to take the law to those who need it. Our technology underpins
                    and enables the largest collection of freely available African legal information
                    in the world, serving hundreds of thousands of users every month.

                  <p><u><strong>Capacity building within African governments</strong></u></p>

                  <p>
                    Many African governments lack the capacity to manage their own legislation and are forced to delegate the consolidation and publication of their laws to private companies. They must then buy back their own laws with restrictive licensing that limits the re-use.
                    Laws.Africa re-capacitates African governments to modernise their legislation publication processes and make foundational legal information available to the public. We believe in open access and ensuring that governments have full ownership of their legislation.
                    We offer our platforms, knowledge base and training to Attorneys General’s offices, Law Reform Commissions, Government Printers, Parliaments and Judiciaries across the continent in support of their work and mandates.
                  </p>

                  <p><u><strong>Capacity building with African civil society organisations</strong></u></p>
                  <p>
                    Laws.Africa works with funders, the legal and justice sectors, and non-profit organisations to help them
                    incorporate primary legal information from our openly licensed collections into their access to justice
                    activities. This enables more efficient, higher-impact outreach and programming.

                    Businesses of all sizes are faced with an ever-greater need for regulatory compliance. Small and
                    medium businesses in particular are negatively affected if they do not have access to up-to-date
                    regulations, placing their businesses, customers and employees at risk.

                    machine learning and app development.
