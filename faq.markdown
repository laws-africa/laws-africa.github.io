  - question: Who are the Laws.Africa contributors?
    answer: |-
      Contributors are community members who benefit from Laws.Africa and have chosen to contribute some of their time or resources to help grow and maintain the Laws.Africa legislation collection. In turn, contributors benefit from the broad collection of legislation available through Laws.Africa and our partners.

      Some contributors are trained legal professionals, some are legal editors who have been working with legislation for many years, while others are open data advocates that believe in the power of free access to law.

      Contributors are usually individuals with an interest in the law, and anyone can become a contributor.
  - question: What does a contributor do?
    answer: |-
      Contributing to Laws.Africa is easy. You can:

      1. Capture and revise legislation in Laws.Africa’s legislation collection.
      2. Identify, report and correct issues in the legislation collection.
      3. Improve the quality of the collection by reviewing the work of other contributors.
      4. Become a Laws.Africa domain specialist by contributing knowledge and legislative updates in subject-matter collections, such as the Environment or Health.
      5. Send us legislation and regulations to add to Laws.Africa.

  - question: What’s in it for me?
    answer: "Your contributions on Laws.Africa (editing, subject knowledge management,
      etc.) will be acknowledged on the system.  \n\nIf you choose to sign up and
      create a profile, your profile will receive prominence as your contributions
      on the system increase. \n\nIn certain instances, Laws.Africa may offer to advertise
      your professional profile and/or services on the main and affiliate sites. \n\nSometimes,
      we may offer paid work (subject to availability of funding and special projects)
      and experienced community members will receive preferential treatment in the
      allocation of opportunities. \n"
  - question: How do I know what contributions are needed?
    answer: "The Laws.Africa system is task-driven. When you sign in, Laws.Africa
      will show you the tasks that are waiting to be completed. Possible tasks include
      applying an amendment, capturing a new piece of legislation, reviewing a contribution,
      or resolving an editorial issue. \n\nLaws.Africa editors, contributors and partners
      all help to determine what tasks need to be done.\n\nWe will also email you
      when a new task is added that you can help out with. You can choose to do any
      task that you’re qualified to do."
  - question: Do contributors get paid?
    answer: |-
      In general, contributors do not get paid.

      Laws.Africa is a non-profit organisation. We believe that everyone should have free access to the law and your contributions help your community to achieve this.

      Sometimes we may offer paid work for particular tasks. Such work is always dependent on available funding.
  - question: When will my contributions get published?
    answer: |-
      All contributions need to be reviewed for quality.

      One of our editors will work with you on your first few contributions. Once your contributions have been made, they will be published on the system after a final quality check by one of our editorial staff.
  - question: Do you offer contributor training?
    answer: |-
      Yes. Our online guides and videos have detailed instructions on making contributions to the Laws.Africa system. They will help you understand how to use the system, and how the process of publishing legislation works.

      Our community leaders are also available to schedule Skype calls to walk you through adding content and working with the Laws.Africa system.
