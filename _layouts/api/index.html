          We monitor a wide range of sources to ensure our legislation data is accurate and up-to-date. New laws
          and amendments are available within ten business days in most countries. Work with both current and
          historical versions and track the changes that were made.

        <h5 class="font-weight-bold">Akoma Ntoso XML</h5>
        <p>
          We use Akoma Ntoso XML, the open, non-proprietary industry standard for legislative documents.
          It’s machine-readable and separates content from structure and presentation. This makes it a powerful
          building block that is easy to integrate into your applications, research tools or machine learning
          pipeline.

      <div class="col-md-4 mb-3">
        <h5 class="font-weight-bold">Machine learning and AI-ready</h5>
        <p>
          Integrate African legislation into your machine learning pipeline, including natural language processing,
          topic modeling, machine translation, document clustering and semantic tagging. Our legislation data is
          uniformly structured across all our country and subject-area collections, making bulk analysis straightforward.

        <h5 class="font-weight-bold">JSON Metadata, HTML, XML and PDF</h5>
        <p>
          Rich JSON metadata includes original publication details, amendments, commencements, repeals and a
          detailed Table of Contents for each law. We provide legislative content in multiple formats:
          Akoma Ntoso XML, presentation-ready HTML, ePUB, and print-ready PDF.

        <p>
          We’re experts in working with Akoma Ntoso XML and legislative data. We can provide your development
          team with technical guidance on integrating with our APIs and data. Let your developers focus on building features, not on understanding XML and the law.
