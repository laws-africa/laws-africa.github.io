The [Free Access to Law Movement](http://www.falm.info/) is an international voluntary association whose members provide and support free access to legal information.

We're excited to announce that Laws.Africa is a member of FALM as of March 2021, and we support the [Declaration on Free Access to Law](http://www.falm.info/declaration/).

We look forward to collaborating and sharing expertise with FALM members, and continuing to strengthen free access to law in Africa and around the world.
