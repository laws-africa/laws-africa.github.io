# Overview

## What is the Laws.Africa Content API?

The Laws.Africa Content API makes it easy to consume and work with the machine-friendly, structured legislation in the Laws.Africa commons. The API is a well-defined way for your systems to fetch legislation content and related information from Laws.Africa.

The Content API treats legislation **as data**, rather than as a PDF or a Word document. This means that a computer can work with the legislation in entirely new ways. For example, you can include legislation in apps, websites and machine learning.

## What is available from the Laws.Africa Content API?

Legislation and related information is available from the Laws.Africa Content API. This includes both the text of the legislation, and supporting information such as amendment and publication details.

### Legislation in XML and HTML

Legislation content is available in machine-friendly, richly structured [Akoma Ntoso XML](http://www.akomantoso.org/) and HTML formats. Work with entire Acts, or focus only on the chapters and sections you need.

### Embeddable HTML

Beautifully formatted HTML snippets with CSS styling ready to be added to your website or app. There is no need to work with XML for many use cases.

### Tables of Contents

Automated Tables of Contents that describe the chapters, parts, sections and schedules of legislation without needing to work directly with XML or HTML.

### Amendments

Details of the amendments that have been applied to a piece legislation, including links to, and details of, the amending work.

### Publication and Promulgation

Dates and details of the initial publication, including gazette numbers, often with links to the gazette PDFs for reference purposes.

### Points in Time

Historical points in time for previous amended versions of legislation, where available.
