            <p>
              Laws.Africa researches, digitises and disseminates high-quality African legislation to partners and
              audiences in Africa and around the world.
            </p>
            <p>
              Making African law freely available supports the rule of law, improves human rights and access to
              justice, enables business and helps communities to thrive.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a member of the global Free Access to Law Movement (FALM), we monitor and address the significant
              deficit of reliable primary legal materials from sub-Saharan Africa in areas such as human rights, the
              environment, commerce and technology. Our core work focuses on digitising and publishing African
              government gazettes, updated legislation and case law.
            </p>
            <p>
              We build cutting edge technology to manage digital legislation databases, and enable access-to-justice
              innovations using structured legislative information. Through our publishing partners, our content
              is available for free to over 450,000 users every month. We provide services, training and support
              to African governments to improve their capacity to manage their legislation, keep it up-to-date, and
              make it freely available to the public.

              Letter from our co-founders
            </h2>
            <p>
              In March 2021 we launched our Uganda national laws collection, a curated set of the most requested Uganda
              national legislation. The collection launched in partnership with ULII.org and, in the first three months,
              received over 130,000 views, indicating the demand and importance of free access to up-to-date
              laws in Africa.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the coming months we will be launching four new legislation collections:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Zimbabwe and South Africa (Provincial), with support from the Indigo Trust;</li>
              <li>Malawi and Zambia, with support from the Indigo Trust and the National Endowment for Democracy (NED); and</li>
              <li>Lesotho, with support from the LII Fund for Africa.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              As the pandemic continues to impact livelihoods and lives across Africa and the world, we’re grateful
              to our funders and partners for continuing to support our mission to improve access to African law,
              and to the Laws.Africa team for their hard work and dedication.
            </p>

            <p>This work matters. Stay safe.</p>

            <p>
              Increased availability of up-to-date legislation makes judicial systems more efficient, improves

            </p>
            <p>
              Between July 2020 and June 2021, we doubled the amount of legislation available to the public
              through our publishing partners.

            <p>
              In June 2021 we launched an updated Uganda Grey Book in partnership with the Uganda Legal Information Institute
              (ULII), a project of the Judiciary of Uganda based in Kampala. The Grey Book is a selection of 98 Acts and 8
              Statutory Instruments are now up-to-date and available, for free, at
              <a href="http://www.ulii.org" target="_blank">www.ulii.org.</a>
            </p>
            <p>
              The year-long project involved hunting down and digitising mouldy gazettes scattered across Kampala,
              reading hundreds of notices to identify amendments and other notices, and finally bringing the 2000
              consolidation up to date. Laws.Africa’s gazette and legislation technology made this process simpler and faster.

            <p>
              The pandemic has changed all our lives and produced what must be the fastest changing set of regulations in
              African history. In South Africa, these regulations change weekly, and ensuring that readers have up-to-dat
              e information is essential.
            </p>
            <p>
              We continue to maintain our special COVID-19 collection and publish them through AfricanLII. In many cases,
              these are the only up-to-date versions of these regulations that are freely available to the public.
            </p>

            <p>
              Our collection includes COVID-19 regulations for 11 countries: Botswana, Ghana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius,

            <p>
              A fire in early 2021 at the University of Cape Town, obliterated the government gazette archives of the
              University. The entire archive of hundreds of thousands of government gazettes from a wide range of
              African countries has been lost. Laws.Africa and AfricanLII were only able to digitise and make public a
              small fraction of these gazettes before this disaster.
            </p>
            <p>
              This disaster has highlighted the urgent need to preserve and expand African digital gazettes archives.
              We are using this opportunity to build global partnerships to help us to continue these activities.
            </p>
            <p>
              We appeal to the legal, librarian and development community to assist us with access to physical gazette
              collections, digitised documents, or funds to help digitise government gazettes.
