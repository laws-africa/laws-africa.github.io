I am currently PGDip Library and Information Studies student at UCT. I am passionate about open access and having information at the disposal of those who need it, especially relating to legislation. Through my time at Laws.Africa I have learnt a great deal about legal information as well as proofreading and editing, furthermore it has sparked an interest in software technology. I have a background in Political Science and International Relations.
