I studied at the University of the Orange Free State where I obtained my Bachelor of Library Science (1982) and Higher Education diploma (1983). Since 2015 I have been Manager of the Legal Knowledge Centre and Web Portal at FNB Legal. I have been an active member and committee member of OSALL. Nothing gives me a bigger thrill than being able to source some obscure piece of information.
