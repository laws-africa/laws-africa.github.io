I obtained my Bachelor of Laws with distinction (2018) and Master of Laws degree (2019) from the University of Witwatersrand. I work as a part-time course facilitator, teaching introductory law courses. I am passionate about legal research and teaching law as it is a tool for promoting and protecting peopleâ€™s rights and interests.
