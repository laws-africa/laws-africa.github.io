Adoupo Jean Francois Régis holds a Master's degree in Public and International Affairs from the University of Montreal, CA; and a Bachelor's degree in Political Science from the University of Central Arkansas, USA. He developed an interest in human rights issues while working for LIDHO (Ligue Ivoirienne des Droits de Hommes) in Côte d'Ivoire.
