Olwyn  Garratt began her professional career as a teacher librarian in both Johannesburg and Durban, but when she moved to Cape Town in 1995 she found work in the Fairbridges law firm library. She registered for online studies with RAU, which morphed into UJ, and she was awarded her Masters degree in information science. She moved back to Johannesburg to take up a position in the firm Bell Dewar & Hall, later known as Fasken, from where she retired in 2019. She continued to do freelance library work in private law firms and for three years she was a volunteer working in the Transnet Heritage Library.
