title: About Laws.Africa
layout: about
lead: We believe that the traditional approach to promoting free access to the law
  requires a fundamental shift. Firstly, putting documents online does not enable
  value creation and is not enough. Secondly, sourcing, consolidating and providing
  open access to the law sustainably requires a new business model for collaboration
  and partnerships.

### Our Goals

* Improve access to the law, stimulate innovation, and lead by example, by
* creating a machine-friendly, openly licensed legislation commons, through
* building a mutually beneficial relationship with a volunteer community, that is
* sustainable through licensing and charging for value-added services and expertise.

### Our Principles

* Access to the law directly and indirectly enables access to justice.
* A legislation commons improves access to the law for everyone.
* A legislation commons promotes justice sector innovation by lowering barriers to entry and reducing undifferentiated heavy lifting.
* Such a commons must be machine-friendly and, ultimately, openly licensed.
* Such a commons can only be sustainably built in mutual collaboration with those who benefit from it.
* Such a commons can be built sustainably through appropriate licensing and the offering of value-added features and services, without limiting the usefulness of the open commons.
