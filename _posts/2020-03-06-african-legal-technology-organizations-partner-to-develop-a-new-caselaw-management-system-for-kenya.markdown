Kenya Law (https://www.kenyalaw.org/) has developed and continues to curate the largest collection of national caselaw in Africa. The official law reporter of the Kenyan government plays a critical role in the organisation, management and dissemination of Kenya’s primary legal materials: legislation and case law. This aids the public, the legal profession and Government, and supports an effective justice sector.

Kenya Law has partnered with the African Legal Information Institute, Laws. Africa NPO and Netrix Business Solutions Ltd. to develop a new web-based software platform to modernise and improve the management of their case law database. The system will support the most effective reporting of case law through the Kenya Law Reports. It will also enable Kenya Law to deliver additional products and value to their users, provide insight into the business processes around case law reporting, and report on developments in Kenyan jurisprudence.

To support these requirements, Kenya Law has identified the need to capture and manage rich, structured data and metadata for Kenyan case law. The new software platform will enable and assist the reporter in capturing, structuring, researching, analysing and publishing this data and its derivative products. Caselaw will be captured and made available in an Akoma Ntoso XML format, which will support Kenya Law in treating the case law database not just as a collection of case reports, but as a valuable, rich, structured dataset of Kenyan jurisprudence that enables the creation of new value-adds for Kenya Law and its stakeholders.

The project will run over the course of two years, from 2020 to 2022.
