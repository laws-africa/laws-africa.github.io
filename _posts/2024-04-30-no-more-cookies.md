At Laws.Africa, we believe that access to legal information should not only be
free but also private and anonymous. These values are part of the founding
declaration of the [Free Access to Law Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Access_to_Law_Movement).

That's why we're excited to share a significant update with our users and
visitors: we have completely eliminated tracking cookies from the network of
Legal Information Institute (LII) websites that we run in collaboration with
AfricanLII. We no longer use Google Analytics and visits are both private and anonymous.

This change is part of our commitment to ensuring that you can access important
legal resources—such as legislation, court judgments, and government
gazettes—without compromising your privacy.

## Anonymity

"We believe that the right to privacy is fundamental, and anonymous access to free legal
resources is an essential part of that," says Ms. Mariya Badeva, founder of AfricanLII
and an expert in access to law in Africa. "By eliminating cookies and enhancing site
performance, AfricanLII and its partner websites are at the forefront of making
legal information accessible while respecting user privacy."

## Faster websites

By removing cookies, we not only protect your anonymity but also improve the
performance of our websites. Without cookies, we can now use advanced caching
techniques to help our pages load faster, allowing you to access the
information you need more quickly and efficiently. This means less time waiting
and more time engaging with critical legal information.

## Privacy-first

Unlike many other sites, our privacy-first approach ensures that your search
history and site interactions remain confidential and anonymous. This commitment sets us
apart in the digital landscape, where data privacy is a top concern for many
users.

We invite you to visit our partner sites such as [AfricanLII.org](https://africanlii.org),
[LawLibrary.org.za](https://lawlibrary.org.za) and [TanzLII](https://tanzlii.org) to
explore our broad collection of African legal information, knowing that
your privacy is preserved, and your access is faster than ever. Share this
development with friends and colleagues who will appreciate both the breadth of
free legal information and the respect for their privacy.
