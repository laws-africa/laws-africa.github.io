Kannaland is the latest municipality we've added to the [openbylaws.org.za](https://openbylaws.org.za) website. We’ve digitised all of Kannaland's by-laws and put them online in user-friendly formats, making them easier to find, read and share.

The Open By-laws website now contains the by-laws of a total of nine municipalities, and we’re working on adding more. Kannaland comes hot on the heels of Cederberg and Bergrivier, which were [added in late March](https://laws.africa/2020/03/24/bergrivier-and-cederberg-by-laws.html).

## Kannaland

[Kannaland municipality](https://openbylaws.org.za/za-wc041/eng/) is in the Garden Route district in the Western Cape and includes the towns of Ladismith at the foot of the Swartberg mountains, Zoar and Calitzdorp. Kannaland has 10 by-laws, covering aspects such as [liquor sales](https://openbylaws.org.za/za-wc041/act/by-law/2013/liquor-trading-days-and-hours/eng/), [water supply and manegement](https://openbylaws.org.za/za-wc041/act/by-law/2003/water/eng/),  and [the prevention of nuisances such as dumping](https://openbylaws.org.za/za-wc041/act/by-law/2003/prevention-of-nuisances/eng/).

## COVID-19

Some aspects of municipal functioning are impacted by the recent government regulations passed due to the COVID-19 coronavirus. These regulations are available at [openbylaws.org.za/covid19](https://openbylaws.org.za/covid19).
