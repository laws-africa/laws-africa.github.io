Bergrivier and Cederberg are the latest two municipalities we have added to the [openbylaws.org.za](https://openbylaws.org.za) website. We’ve digitised all of their by-laws and put them online in user-friendly formats, making them easier to find, read and share.

The Open By-laws website now contains the by-laws of a total of eight municipalities, and we’re working on adding more.

## Bergrivier

[Bergrivier municipality](https://openbylaws.org.za/za-wc013/eng/) in the Western Cape includes the towns of Piketberg, Velddrif and Porterville, and has an estimated population of about 67 000 people. Bergrivier has 30 by-laws, covering aspects such as [liquor sales](https://openbylaws.org.za/za-wc013/act/by-law/2018/control-of-undertakings-that-sell-liquor-to-the-public/eng/), [municipal land-use planning](https://openbylaws.org.za/za-wc013/act/by-law/2018/municipal-land-use-planning/eng/),  and [informal trading](https://openbylaws.org.za/za-wc013/act/by-law/2009/informal-trading/eng/).
