This guide is for developers who want to use the API to fetch legislative works. We assume that you have a basic understanding of REST APIs and the [Akoma Ntoso](http://www.akomantoso.org/) standard for legislation (acts in particular).

The API relies heavily on Akoma Ntoso FRBR URIs, which are described in the [Akoma Ntoso naming convention standard](http://docs.oasis-open.org/legaldocml/akn-nc/v1.0/akn-nc-v1.0.html).
{:.alert.alert-info}

The API is a read-only API for listing and fetching published versions of legislative works. Using it, you can:

* get a list of countries and localities
* get a list of all works by country and year
* get a JSON description of a work
* get Akoma Ntoso XML for a work
* get a human-friendly HTML version of a work

When we use a URL such as ``/v2/frbr-uri/`` in this guide, the ``frbr-uri`` part is a full FRBR URI, such as ``/akn/za/act/1998/84/eng``.

# Quick Start

First, sign up for a free Laws.Africa account at [https://edit.laws.africa/accounts/login/](https://edit.laws.africa/accounts/login/).

Next, get your API token from [https://edit.laws.africa/accounts/profile/api/](https://edit.laws.africa/accounts/profile/api/).

In the examples below, replace ``<YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN>`` with your personal API token.
{:.alert.alert-info}

Let's fetch the details of Cape Town's Animal by-law, in JSON format. This includes the title, publication details and a list of other
API calls you can make for additional details.

```bash
$ curl -H "Authorization: Token <YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN>" \
  https://api.laws.africa/v2/akn/za-cpt/act/by-law/2011/animal.json
```

Laws.Africa can provide us with a Table of Contents for the by-law, also in JSON format. Let's fetch that:

```bash
$ curl -H "Authorization: Token <YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN>" \
  https://api.laws.africa/v2/akn/za-cpt/act/by-law/2011/animal/toc.json
```

Now let's get the HTML content of Section 3 of the by-law, regarding dog registration and licensing:

```bash
$ curl -H "Authorization: Token <YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN>" \
  https://api.laws.africa/v2/akn/za-cpt/act/by-law/2011/animal/eng/main/section/3.html
```

Finally, let's put that HTML into a webpage and include some stylesheets to make it look good:

# Works and Expressions

Two important concepts that are an essential part of the API are **works** and **expressions**.

* A **Work** is a piece of legislation, such as an act, regulation or by-law. A work may be amended over time and may even have its title changed. A work is uniquely identified by a *work FRBR URI* which never changes.
* An **Expression** is a version of a Work in specific language at a particular point in time. A work can have many expressions, usually one for each official language and amendment. An expression is uniquely identified by its own *expression FRBR URI*, which is derived from the work's FRBR URI.

An example of a work is the South African *Employment Equity Amendment Act,
2013 (Act 55 of 1998)* with unique work FRBR URI ``/akn/za/act/1998/55``. This act has
been amended a number of times since it was first passed. Each amended version
(also called a *point in time*) is a unique expression of the work.

The English expression of the work, as it was amended on 17 January 2014, is
uniquely identified by the expression FRBR URI ``/act/1998/55/eng@2014-01-17``.
You can see that this is built from the work's URI, with a language code
``eng`` and the expression date ``2014-01-17`` included.

When fetching details from the API, you are always fetching details for a
particular expression of the work. The expression will also include information
related to the expression's work, such as the work's FRBR URI and publication
information.  Even if you don't specific a particular date for the expression,
the API will return the latest expression applicable for the date of the
request.
{:.alert.alert-info}

# Authentication

Calls to the API must be authenticated using your API token. To get a token,

1. Sign up for a free Laws.Africa account at [https://edit.laws.africa/accounts/login/](https://edit.laws.africa/accounts/login/).
2. Get your API token from [https://edit.laws.africa/accounts/profile/api/](https://edit.laws.africa/accounts/profile/api/).

Include your API token in your API calls by including an ``Authorization`` header:

    Authorization: Token YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN

If you're logged into your Laws.Africa account, you can also browse the API using your web browser and visiting [https://api.laws.africa/v2/countries](https://api.laws.africa/v2/countries).

# Pagination

API calls that return lists will be paginated and return a limited number
of items per page. The response includes information on the total number of
items and the URLs to use to fetch the next and previous pages of items.

Here's an example of the first page of a paginated response with 250 total items and two pages:


```json
{
  "count": 250,
  "next": "https://api.laws.africa/v2/akn/za.json?page=2",
  "previous": null,
  "results": [ "..." ]
}
```

In this case, fetching the ``next`` URL will return the second (and final) page.

# Content types

Some API calls can return content in multiple formats. You can specify the
required content of your request by placing ``.format`` at the end of the URL.
In most cases the default response type is JSON.

* ``.json`` or ``Accept: application/json``: return JSON
* ``.xml`` or ``Accept: application/xml``: return Akoma Ntoso XML
* ``.html`` or ``Accept: text/html``: return human friendly HTML
* ``.epub`` or ``Accept: application/epub+zip``: return an ePUB (ebook) document
* ``.pdf`` or ``Accept: application/pdf``: return a PDF document
* ``.zip`` or ``Accept: application/zip``: return a ZIP file with the document XML and media attachments

Not all responses support all formats, the documentation will be explicit about what is supported.
{.alert.alert-info}

# Countries and Localities

    GET https://api.laws.africa/v2/countries.json

This returns a list of the countries and localities that Laws.Africa knows about. It includes
links to the APIs for listing works for each country and locality.

# Listing Works

    GET https://api.laws.africa/v2/akn/za/
    GET https://api.laws.africa/v2/akn/za/act/
    GET https://api.laws.africa/v2/akn/za/act/2007/

* Content types: JSON, PDF, EPUB, ZIP

These endpoints list the works for a country or year.  To list the available
works for a country you'll need the [two-letter country code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) for the country.

The listings include the most recent applicable expressions of each work, in the country's default language.

# Fetching a Work

    GET https://api.laws.africa/v2/frbr-uri.json

This returns the detail of an expression of a work as a JSON document. For example, this is the
description of the English expression of Act 55 of 1998 as at 2014-01-07.

## Akoma Ntoso

    GET https://api.laws.africa/v2/frbr-uri.xml

This returns the Akoma Ntoso XML of an expression of a work.

For example, fetch the most recent applicable English Akoma Ntoso expression of ``/akn/za/act/1998/55`` by calling:

    GET https://api.laws.africa/v2/akn/za/act/1998/55/eng.xml

## HTML

    GET https://api.laws.africa/v2/frbr-uri.html

For example, fetch the most recent applicable English HTML expression of ``/akn/za/act/1998/55`` by calling:

    GET https://api.laws.africa/v2/akn/za/act/1998/55/eng.html

## Expressions

You can fetch specific expressions of a work by including expression-specific information in the requested FRBR URI.
The API supports the language and date aspects defined in the
[Akoma Ntoso naming convention standard](http://docs.oasis-open.org/legaldocml/akn-nc/v1.0/akn-nc-v1.0.html).

For example, this request will fetch the HTML of the English expression of Act 55 of 1998, as amended on 2014-01-17:

    GET https://api.laws.africa/v2/akn/za/act/1998/55/eng@2014-01-17.html

The available expressions of a work are listed in the ``points_in_time`` field
of the JSON description of the work. Each point in time includes a date and a
list of expressions available at that date, one for each available language.

You can use the following date formats to request different expressions of a work.

|Date Format                           |Meaning                                            |Example Expression FRBR URI
|---                                   |---                                                |---
|``@``                                 |Very first expression of a work.                   |<nobr><code>/akn/za/act/1998/55/eng@</code></nobr>
|<nobr><code>@YYYY-MM-DD</code></nobr> |Expression at the specific date.                   |<nobr><code>/akn/za/act/1998/55/eng@2014-01-17</code></nobr>
|<nobr><code>:YYYY-MM-DD</code></nobr> |Most recent expression at or before a date.        |<nobr><code>/akn/za/act/1998/55/eng:2015-01-01</code></nobr>
|(none)                                |The most recent expression at or before today's date. Equivalent to using ``:`` with today's date.|<nobr><code>/akn/za/act/1998/55/eng</code></nobr>
{:.table.table-striped.table-sm}

The ``.format`` part of the FRBR URI is placed after the ``@YYYY-MM-DD`` part.

If you use ``@`` to specify a particular date and the API doesn't have a
version at exactly that date, it will return a 404 response. If you need
the expression of the work closest to a particular date, use ``:`` instead.

## Parts, Chapters and Sections

You can use the ``url`` field from an item in the table of contents to fetch the details of just that item
in various forms.

    GET https://api.laws.africa/v2/frbr-uri/toc-item-uri.format

* Content types: XML, HTML, PDF, ePUB, ZIP

# Using HTML Responses

Laws.Africa transforms Akoma Ntoso XML into HTML5 content that looks best when styled with
[Indigo Web](https://github.com/laws-africa/indigo-web) stylesheets. You can link
to the stylesheets provided by that package, or you can pull them into your website.

# Search

    GET https://api.laws.africa/v2/search/<country>?q=<search-term>

* Where `<country>` is a two-letter country code
* Parameter ``q``: the search string
* Content types: JSON

This API searches for works in a country. It returns all works that match the
search term in either their title or their body.  Results are returned in
search rank order.  Each result also has a numeric ``_rank`` and an HTML
``_snippet`` with highlighted results.

If more than one expression of a particular work matches the search, then only
the most recent matching expression is returned.
