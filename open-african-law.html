      <p class="lead">
        Open access to the law is a key part of a successful Open Government strategy. It promotes good governance,
        human rights and access to justice, and enables efficient and effective judicial systems.
        We believe that governments should own their legal information, without restrictive licensing.

      <p class="lead">
        Access to the law lowers the cost of doing business and improves local and foreign investment.
        Small businesses and the informal sector are an essential part of African economies, yet they have limited access
        to professional legal advice and resources. Free access to foundational legal information helps these businesses
        to grow and support families and communities.
