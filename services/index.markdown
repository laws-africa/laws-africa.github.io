  <h2>Legislation and Policy Document Digitisation</h2>

  <p class="lead">
    We are leaders in converting African legal and policy materials into consistent, machine-readable Akoma Ntoso XML (AKN), the industry standard format for legislative documents.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>AKN is machine-readable and enables access-to-justice innovations through analysis and machine learning technologies.</li>
    <li>AKN enables a wide range of automated publication outputs, including for web, mobile, e-book (Kindle, EPUB) and print-ready PDF from a single source of truth.</li>
    <li>We model legislative documents using AKN and provide guidance and expertise on applying the standard to a variety of document types and legislative traditions.</li>
    <li>We provide guidance on how to effectively use Akoma Ntoso in a range of organisations to maximise its impact and help users find the information they need.</li>
    <li>Our AKN4Africa recommendation describes how to name and identify a wide variety of African legal and policy materials using the Akoma Ntoso Naming Convention.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Legal information technology</h2>

  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Our open source <a href="/indigo">Indigo Legislation Platform</a> makes managing and publishing a database of machine-readable legislation easy. Indigo supports amendments, point-in-time comparison, complex commencements and multiple output formats.</li>
    <li>We conduct ongoing user research to understand the needs of a wide range of legal information users and stakeholders across Africa, and use this to continually improve the availability and accessibility of this information.</li>
    <li>Our legal information technology underpins <a href="https://africanlii.org">AfricanLII.org</a> and enables the largest collection of freely available African legal information in the world, serving hundreds of thousands of users each month.</li>
